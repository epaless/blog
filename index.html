        <h2>Otherworldly-Looking Deep-Sea Creatures</h2>
        <h3>The deep sea is a fascinating and largely unexplored realm, home to a variety of otherworldly creatures that thrive in extreme conditions. In the pitch-black depths, where sunlight never penetrates, organisms have evolved unique adaptations to survive.</h3>
        <i><p>Let's dive into the mysterious depths of the ocean, where some of the planet's most bizarre and captivating creatures dwell.</p></i>

        <h2>The Ribbon Sawtail Fish</h2>

        <p><a href="https://liveit.earth/news/2024/1/16/deep-sea-program-discover-the-most-terrifyingly-awesome-deep-sea-creature">The ribbon sawtail fish</a> is a type of deep-sea fish that belongs to the family of barbeled dragonfish. It is distinguished by its unique serrated tail fin that resembles a saw, giving it both its name and remarkable agility in the water. The sawtail fish features a light-dangling from its chin, known as a bioluminescent lure. This unique adaptation helps attract prey in the dark depths of the ocean, making it easier for the fish to hunt small organisms.
        <br>
        <i> Any animal with long, transparent fangs and a light dangling from its chin will never feel like something "from Earth."</i></p>

        <h2>The Fangtooth</h2>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangtooth">Fangtooths</a> are beryciform fish of the family Anoplogastridae that live in the deep sea. It is notable for its incredibly large, fang-like teeth that are disproportionate to its small size, giving it a fearsome appearance.
        <br>
        Fangtooth fish look horrifying, but they've never been a threat to humans given how small they actually are.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fangtooth fish are carnivores that will eat anything they can kill.               
            </li>
            <li> They have the largest teeth proportionate to their body size of any fish in the ocean.

            </li>
            <li> They have extremely compressed bodies with huge heads, enormous jaws and a gruesome, corpse-like appearance.

        <h2>Frilled Shark</h2>

        <p>The frilled shark, often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frilled_shark">"living fossil"</a>. Fortunately, this shark spends most of its time deep in the ocean. As a result, <a href="https://oceana.org/marine-life/frilled-shark/">little is known about it</a>... and I think it's best we keep it that way.</p>

        <h2>Blobfish</h2>

        <p>This unfortunate-looking fish was unanimously voted the "ugliest animal alive." Their strange bodies help them deal with the immense pressure of the deep sea. When brought to the surface, it loses its shape, which is why it looks so different out of its natural habitat.
        <br> (This is how they look <a href="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.nGSHm1jqDhDcYzG58Vl1TQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180">underwater</a>.)</p>

        <p>The Pelican eel, or Gulper eel, is a fascinating deep-sea creature known for its large mouth and elongated body. When the gulper eel encounters prey, its mouth expands like a balloon creating a giant net, allowing it to swallow prey much larger than itself. They also inflate their mouth to intimidate predators. They're a very odd creatures that gulp down things bigger than themselves and inside those enormous mouth is a series of teeth facing backwards ensuring that anything that enters its mouth can never get out.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcastic_fringehead">The Sarcastic Fringehead</a> is a fish native to the eastern Pacific and prefers to hide in objects and cavities, such as shells, burrows, and crevices. Female Sarcastic Fringeheads will look for a male with a desirable territory, she lays her eggs inside the male's home and then leaves. After which the male guards until they hatch, 
        this explains their aggressive behaviour.</p>
        <p>When this fish opens its mouth, it looks like the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dead_by_daylight_stranger_things.jpg">Demogorgon</a> from Stranger Things. This hot-tempered fish aggressively kisses anyone who goes near its territory.</p>
        <i>If this is the Sarcastic Fringehead, I'd like to see the Serious Fringehead.</i>
